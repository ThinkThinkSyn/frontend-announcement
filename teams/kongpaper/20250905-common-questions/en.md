Since its launch, KongPaper has received a large amount of user feedback and questions. To help everyone better understand and use KongPaper, we have compiled some frequently asked questions and their answers. If you have other questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us at any time.


## Slow Response/Generation Errors?
Our AI services are all self-deployed. Due to resource limitations and the current surge in user numbers, services may sometimes respond slowly or generate errors. We are actively seeking to expand server resources to improve service quality.

Additionally, new features will have an adaptation period after launch, during which there may be many unknown bugs. We will gradually fix them. During this period, you can try regenerating, or changing parameters (prompt/double-line split article paragraph submission/...) and other methods to verify whether the problem is resolved.

If the problem persists, please contact us to report the situation.

## Why have my previously generated test papers/grading results disappeared?
Due to the rapid expansion of features recently, the database structure will continue to change, and some historical data may not be displayed on the frontend (webpage) due to incompatibility with the new structure. We will try our best to preserve important data and make modifications, but we cannot guarantee that all historical data can be migrated. During this period, please backup important data as much as possible, including test papers and grading results.

## OCR recognition inaccurate?
The current OCR system mainly supports printed text and a small amount of handwritten text recognition. We are actively deploying new models to improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency of Chinese and English handwriting. During this period, the OCR function may be temporarily unavailable.

## What is the purpose of the `Wish Pool`?
The `Wish Pool` is our main channel for collecting user feedback and suggestions. We regularly review and evaluate these suggestions, and try to prioritize the features most desired by users as our future development direction. Although we cannot guarantee that every suggestion will be adopted, we highly value user opinions and will strive to improve KongPaper.

## What new features are coming soon?
Based on feedback from the wish pool and our internal planning, the following features will be launched in the coming weeks, listed in order of release:
1. More powerful OCR system
2. English Listening (Paper 3) generation
3. Homework Q&A ChatBot (synchronously integrated with WhatsApp)
4. Chinese literature essay grading
5. IELTS speaking practice (DSE English speaking involves multi-person speaking scenarios, requiring longer development time)
6. Mathematics mock paper generation
7. Chinese literature grading
8. Chinese History/World History long-answer grading

## Team Introduction
KongPaper started in 2023 and is one of the projects under Hong Kong startup ThinkThinkSyn. Most team members are from the Computer Science Department of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (welcome to apply for CU CS).

We are committed to achieving cost-effective AI applications through our self-developed low-cost inference framework, promoting healthier business models and bringing cutting-edge technology to broader vertical fields. At KongPaper, we believe AI is the key to promoting educational equity. Through customized AI tools, we achieve truly personalized teaching.

## Why is it free? What is KongPaper's business model?
Our low-cost distributed inference framework has greatly reduced costs. Without relying on third-party cloud services (such as OpenAI), through our special hardware architecture and load balancing technology, KongPaper can provide high-quality AI services at less than one ten-thousandth of the physical cost.

We are confident that we can support the entire system's operating costs with less than 10% of paying users. For ordinary students and teachers, we hope to maintain completely free services, similar to the Duolingo model.

For educational institutions/enterprises, we will launch advanced subscription services in the future to provide more advanced features:
- Class management/grade analysis/personalized test papers and learning plans based on individual abilities
- Internal RAG system, supporting uploading teaching materials for Q&A
- API access permissions, convenient for integration into existing teaching systems
- Customized model fine-tuning services to meet specific teaching needs
- Offline deployment options to ensure data privacy and security

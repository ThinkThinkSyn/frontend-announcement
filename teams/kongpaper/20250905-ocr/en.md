## OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System Maintenance Notice
Currently, our OCR system only supports recognition of printed fonts and a limited amount of handwritten text. Considering the demand for handwriting recognition in Chinese and English compositions, we are actively deploying new models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of handwriting recognition, and expect to complete the update by next week. During this period, OCR functionality may be temporarily unavailable.

## Expected New Features
- Support for Chinese and English handwriting recognition
- Automatic identification of valid handwritten areas, ignoring invalid areas outside the article.
